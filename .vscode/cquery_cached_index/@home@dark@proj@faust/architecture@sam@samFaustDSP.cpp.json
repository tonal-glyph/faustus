This method can be used concurrently with\n [`keyOn`](#keyOn) and [`keyOff`](#keyOff).\n\n `propagateMidi` can\n only be used if the `[style:poly]` metadata is used in\n the Faust code or if `-polyvoices` flag has been\n provided before compilation.\n\n #### Arguments\n\n * `count`: size of the message (1-3)\n * `time`: time stamp\n * `type`: message type (byte)\n * `channel`: channel number\n * `data1`: first data byte (should be `null` if `count<2`)\n * `data2`: second data byte (should be `null` if `count<3`)\n--------------------------------------------------------","declarations":[],"spell":"122:19-122:32|4|2|2","extent":"122:1-125:2|-1|1|0","declaring_type":4,"bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[24,25,26,27,28,29],"uses":[],"callees":["124:18-124:31|10|3|36"]},{"id":10,"usr":10802542785999597160,"detailed_name":"","short_name_offset":0,"short_name_size":0,"kind":0,"storage":0,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[],"uses":["124:18-124:31|9|3|36"],"callees":[]}],"vars":[{"id":0,"usr":2776914594435925635,"detailed_name":"std::list<GUI
