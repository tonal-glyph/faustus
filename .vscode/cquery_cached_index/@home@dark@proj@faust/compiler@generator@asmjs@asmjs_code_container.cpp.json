be declared first, then functions, then export section.\n   2) the DSP data structure fields are not generated. The structure size is computed instead, and memory\nallocation/deallocation is done outside of the module using emscripten (or 'self-made') memory functions. 3) in\ncompute, 'inputs/outputs' will point to audio buffers allocated outside of the module. Access on this buffers is\ngenerated in an 'adhoc' manner... 4) TypingVisitor is used to know value types :\n      - 'funcalls' types are not known by TypingVisitor, so the CodeContainer::pushFunction adds kInt32ish, kFloatish\nor kDoublish and ASMJAVAScriptInstVisitor::visit(CastInst* inst) interprets kInt32ish, kFloatish or kDoublish\n      - ASMJAVAScriptInstVisitor::visit(BinopInst* inst) adds the type of result\n   5) MoveVariablesInFront2 FIR ==> FIR passes are used to move variable declaration at the beginning of blocks.\n   6) 'fmodf' and 'log10f' mathematical functions are manually generated.\n   7) 'buffer' argument is the actual emscripten (or 'self-made') memory buffer and will contain the DSP object\nstructure and 'inputs/outputs' audio buffers. 8) subcontainer generation :\n      - tables (as type kStaticStruct) are treated as 'mydsp' fields\n      - 'mydsp' classInit method is changed so that methods on subcontainers are rewritten as normal function calls\n      - subcontainer are merged in the global container : fields, functions definition...\n      - use of 'sig' variable name is translated in 'dsp'\n      - subcontainer is not allocated/deallocated anymore\n   9) pointers are actually integers, so are treated like this\n   10) waveforms are also allocated in the DSP object heap. Array definition is not done in 'global' part but in\n'inits' methods (see InstructionsCompiler::declareWaveform()). Since 'in extention' array definition is not possible,\nthe FIR code is first rewritten to a list of 'store' instructions (MoveVariablesInFront2), then the actual code is\ngenerated. 11) 'faustpower' function actually fallback to regular 'pow' (see powprim.h), otherwise incorrectly typed\n'faustpower' is
