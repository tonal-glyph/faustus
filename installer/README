FAUST : a programming language for audio applications and plugins
GRAME : Centre National de Creation Musicale. http://www.grame.fr


In this folder you will find various installation scripts that take care of installing 
the dependencies needed to work with Faust on a Linux machine. These scripts are useful
if you want to compile Faust yourself and use the latest git version

The scripts are organized in plateforms (currently only ubuntu1404) and four levels of 
installation:

- unbuntu1404:
    - install.min.sh        : level1, install the minimal dependencies to compiler faust, master and faust2 branches
    - install.regular.sh    : level2, add additional packages to create alsa and jack applications
    - install.developper.sh : level3, add packages to compile audio applications and plugins for most formats 
    - install.full.sh       : level4, install everything including latex for automatique documentation
