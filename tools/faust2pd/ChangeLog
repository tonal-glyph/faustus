	+ Release 2.12

	* For better compatibility with pd-faust and older faust2pd
	versions, parse the 'pd' meta data on the toplevel group in JSON
	format. Also, make --slider-nums the default, and add a new
	--no-slider-nums option to disable this feature.

2014-11-04  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	+ Release 2.11

	* Bugfixes. Version bump needed since broken package was out
	already.

2014-11-03  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	+ Release 2.10

	* Add JSON support (faust -json, httpd JSON interface).

2014-09-17  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	+ Release 2.8

	* Pass the -mcpu=generic option to llc when batch-compiling Pure
	scripts, to prevent illegal instructions depending on the build
	host's cpu type.

2009-08-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	+ Release 2.2

	* faustxml.pure: Compatibility fixes for Pure 0.26+ (new nonfix
	keyword).

2009-03-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	+ Release 2.1

	* Makefile, faust2pd.pure: The faust2pd script is now compiled to
	a native executable before installation. This makes the program
	start up much faster, which is a big advantage because most xml
	files don't take long to be processed. You'll need Pure 0.21 or
	later to make this work.

2009-03-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	+ Release 2.0

	* faust2pd.pure: Windows compatibility fixes.

2009-03-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* ported to Pure:

	  - source reorganization, other minor cosmetic changes

	  - renamed -f (--fake-buttons) option to -b

	  - new -f (--font-size) option to specify GUI font sizes

	  - command line options can now also be specified using special
	    [pd:...] tags in the Faust source

	  - seqdemo example now uses pd-pure

	  - updated documentation, documentation is now also available in
	    html format

	  - license updated to GPL V3

2008-08-11  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* faust2pd/faustxml.q: Fixes for latest (CVS) Faust XML format.

2007-10-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	+ Release 1.1

	* bump version number

	* Makefile: add dist target

2007-10-07  Albert Graef  <ag@muwiinfa.geschichte.uni-mainz.de>

	* Makefile: various changes to the make install/uninstall goals

	- add missing rm command for installed link in <prefix>/bin

	- make sure that missing install directories are created; this is
	necessary to make 'make install' work with a staging directory
	
	- install faust2pd into <prefix>/share/q/apps, where application
	scripts should go as of Q 7.8, to keep the main library directory
	clean

	- install faust2pd README into <prefix>/share/q/etc

	- it's bad to have a hardcoded pddatadir, use a second prefix
	variable 'pdprefix' instead

	* faust2pd/faust2pd.q, faust2pd/faustxml.q: updated to Q 7.8

2006-10-05  Albert Graef  <ag@>

	+ Release 1.0

	* faust2pd/faust2pd.q, faust2pd/faust-timer.pd: Change the update
	logic of the passive controls to use a custom timer (metro)
	instead of bang~, so that we don't eat up too much cpu. The update
	cycle now defaults to 100 ms. This can be changed with the global
	faust-timer receiver.

2006-10-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* faust/puredata.cpp: do proper crossfades for "active" control,
	to prevent clicking when "active" is turned on and off

	* faust2pd/faust2pd.q: fixed wrong version number, added comment
	to generated patches

2006-09-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* README: updated and completed documentation

	* Makefile: make /usr/local the default install prefix

	* faust/puredata.cpp, faust2pd/faust2pd.q: separate control inlet,
	fully qualified control names now have '/' in front, special
	"active" control

2006-09-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/*/Makefile: cosmetic changes
