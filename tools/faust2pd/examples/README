- basic/test.pd: Basic example of Pd-Faust externals, without faust2pd.

- faust/faustdemo.pd: Sample dsps from the Faust distribution, with
  faust2pd-generated GUIs.

- synth/synth.pd: A complete MIDI-driven synth-effects chain. Only Faust
  synths and effects with faust2pd-generated GUIs were used in this example.

- seqdemo/seqdemo.pd: A step sequencer example. The sound generation is done
  with Faust dsps, the sequencer is implemented in Pure. (This needs pd-pure
  to run, get it at http://purelang.bitbucket.org/.)
