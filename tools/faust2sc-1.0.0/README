faust2sc (by Stefan Kersten)
----------------------------

Faust can produce an XML description of a plugin, including various meta data
and the structural layout of the user interface. This information is used by
faust2sc to generate SuperCollider class file, which can be compiled and
subsequently used from within sclang.

Since version 1.1.0 faust2sc supports multiple output languages. Currently
support for the languages has been implemented:

* SuperCollider (sclang)
* Haskell
